[01] Planning a Raspberry Pi workstation
6th Feb 2024

[ DRAFT POST ]

<pre id="main"><br><br>
Since I feel like most of my friends and family won't understand any of the jargon on this page,
I'll explain everything like you have no idea what Linux is!
<br><br>
Linux is a family of open-source (meaning: the code that runs it is publicly available)
operating systems (meaning: the software that tells computers how to work and interact with
its parts).
<br><br>
With that out the way, we can begin! I want to create a Linux system on a Raspberry Pi device.
I like these devices because, unlike modern high-power devices, these are very limited in ability
and therefore enforce creative methods. I'd love to make this operating system perfect for code
development and I want it to run mostly console-based programs. I would also like the hardware
of the Pi to look really cool, carefully choosing a case and potentially other peripherals to
make up a cute and portable development station.
<br><br>
So how?
<br><br>
Well the process of that, quite obviously, starts with choosing my hardware requirements. I've
decided I want to use the window manager i3, and if you don't know, a window manager is a program
that determines how windows are displayed on-screen. i3 uses tiling, which means windows are
automatically sized and positioned as to prevent them from overlapping. Another notable feature
is that i3 uses keyboard controls to navigate the system, rather than using the mouse (though
the mouse is still visible, in case a program you use requires it).
<br><br>
I also need to consider which other non-terminal applications I'll use. This scope probably
won't be any bigger than a web browser.
<br><br>
With these in mind, I need to choose a RAM size for the Pi that facilitates both of these
without running into problems. 4GB of RAM is probably more than enough. I think I'll go
for the Raspberry Pi 5, as the Pi 4 is the same price with the same amount of RAM anyway
so there's no point in choosing the lower spec. As for the Operating System, I'll use
Raspberry Pi OS Lite because this is currently the best OS for minimal installations on
the Pi while also including support for hardware adjustments.
<br><br>
Now the fun part: the case!
<br><br>
NOTE: at the time of writing, it seems financially wasteful to spend money on this idea
so it's saved for another time.
