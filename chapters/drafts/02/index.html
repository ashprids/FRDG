[02] Talking about House M.D.
13th Feb 2024

[ DRAFT POST ]
</pre>
<pre id="main"><br><br>
For those wondering, my favourite TV shows are the following in no particular order:
<br><br>
1. It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia<br>
2. House M.D. <br>
3. IT Crowd<br>
<br><br>
If you've watched all of these, you can confirm that the odd one out here is House. 
I usually prefer comedy shows/sitcoms so to put a Hospital Drama show on the list...?
<br><br>
I don't exactly have my friends' top 10s on speed dials so I can't exactly compare 
with like-minded people to determine whether or not they have same-genre shows on the 
list. Regardless of whether or not it's out of place, my main motive for watching it 
was always to see what House would make the others do, or do himself. He's a character 
type I really admire; he acts in no regard for how other people will think of him, 
therefore enabling him to perform unethical and illegal activities in the name of saving 
others. This character who may come across as "careless" is probably the most determined 
in the entire hospital to save as many lives as he can.
<br><br>
<br><br>
For those curious, this was originally going to be a review on Amber's character, and why
I think her time on the show is the best. Even planned a spoiler warning page for it and
everything. Unfortunately, I felt unmotivated to keep blabbering on about this (shrug)
