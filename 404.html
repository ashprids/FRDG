<!-- 404 PAGE 
Fun fact: since this 404 page's directory is relative to the directory of whichever page it's called from,
any links are ALSO relative to that directory. Therefore, we need to use absolute paths for any links which is
why the stylesheet and favicon are linked to the full URL.

This is the only page that does this (at least as of 16th Mar 2024).

Sorry, the page you're trying to find no longer exists.
Or maybe it never did in the first place...
Or maybe it doesn't yet.
